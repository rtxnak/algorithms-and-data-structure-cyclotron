# algorithms-and-data-structure-cyclotron

## About project
this is the cyclotron algorithm, we can add the particles e, p, n (electron, proton, and neutron). Each particle has a circulation function within the cyclotron, which can create either a closed or an open cycle.

## Instructions for use

On terminal:

1. Please install and check the version of Node on your system:
[NPM & Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
```bash
  node -v
```

2. Clone the repository

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:rtxnak/algorithms-and-data-structure-cyclotron.git
```

3. To use the algorithm you must add a `console.log()` in the `cyclotron.js` file according to the examples shown

* input format is cyclotron(particleType, matrixSize)

- particleType = particle type (e,p,n)
- matrixSize = particle matrix size (minimum size of 4)

4. To run the cyclotron just run the command:

```bash
  node cyclotron.js
```
